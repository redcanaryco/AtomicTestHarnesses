# AtomicTestHarnesses

AtomicTestHarnesses is a PowerShell module that simulates and validates attack
technique execution.

The details of a technique can vary from attack to attack; AtomicTestHarnesses
accounts for this by allowing you to execute many variations of a technique at
once. AtomicTestHarnesses also validates the telemetry generated during
execution, so you always know whether your simulations were successful.
