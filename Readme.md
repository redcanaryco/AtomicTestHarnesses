# AtomicTestHarnesses

AtomicTestHarnesses is a library that simulates and validates attack technique
execution. It consists of a Powershell module for running attack techniques on
Windows and also a Python package for running on macOS and Linux

The details of a technique can vary from attack to attack; AtomicTestHarnesses
accounts for this by allowing you to execute many variations of a technique at
once. AtomicTestHarnesses also validates the telemetry generated during
execution, so you always know whether your simulations were successful.
